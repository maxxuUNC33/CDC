#Inspiration
Floods are one of the worst natural disasters that wipe away what humanity has built. It is important to understand the health-risks of flooding so that we can be better prepared to thrive after flooding.

#What it does
Create a geographic model to predict Flood Health Vulnerability Index based on latitude and longitude values around San Francisco

#How we built it
We used Dataiku to construct our model in conjunction with Tableau to visualize our data. We also used python to generate and clean our data.

#Challenges we ran into
Finding a geographic dataset that matched with the given dataset, Finding a model that could show something new from the data.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to accurately predict a location's vulnerability to flooding based on latitude and longitude.

#What we learned
We learned how to use tools such as Tableau and Dataiku, as well as what goes into generating and justifying the graphs we see generated from big data online.

#What's next for Fear of Floods: Flood Health Vulnerability Index
We would like to find similar datasets from past years in order to model the change of the Flood Health Vulnerability Index with regards to location over time. We believe that any changes we might see would relate heavily to the movement of demographic groups.
